Module Projects 
Each module of the course will include a team-based module project.

Individual Course Project 
In addition to the module projects, students will also complete an individual project over the semester. You may choose any of the above 6 themes for your individual project, and it may relate to any aspect of deep learning covered during the course (computer vision, NLP, recommendation systems, or tabular/structured data prediction). The project will culminate in the development of a prototype interactive web or mobile application which runs on the cloud. Beginning Week 5, each week students will submit a 1-3 minute video demo/update of their progress on the project during that week.

Research Paper Presentations
Because our field is evolving so quickly, developing an ability to read and interpret academic research papers on the latest advances in the field is critical to long-term success. As part of the course, each student will make a 5-10 minute video presentation on a relevant deep learning research paper of their choice. The objective of the presentation is to clearly convey the key novel methods or findings from the research paper in a manner that the rest of the class understands the “so what” of the paper.
