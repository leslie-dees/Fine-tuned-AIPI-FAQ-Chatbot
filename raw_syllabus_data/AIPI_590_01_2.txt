Recent Advancements Presentations
Because this field is evolving so quickly, developing an ability to read and interpret academic research papers on the latest advances in the field is critical to long-term success.  As part of the course, each student will conduct one 10-minute talks during the semester on recent notable advancements related to LLMs that have occurred in the past 6 months.
