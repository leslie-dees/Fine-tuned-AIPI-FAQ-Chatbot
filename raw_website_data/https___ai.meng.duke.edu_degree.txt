Duke Undergrads: 4+1: BSE+Master's

The Pratt School of Engineering's 4+1: BSE+Master option allows Duke students to earn an undergraduate degree and a master's in five years. Students may choose to start the Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence (AI MEng) during their undergraduate senior year.

Students who receive admission to the AI MEng program through 4+1 may allocate up to four (4) graduate courses taken in their senior year toward Master of Engineering requirements. In addition, participating students may take graduate-level electives or AI MEng core courses in their senior year. This provides greater flexibility when scheduling the fifth year, and Duke 4+1 students are eligible for the AI MEng Duke 4+1 scholarship.

Further details may be found on the 4+1: BSE+Master's webpage . To discuss AI MEng course options for senior year, contact program director Jon Reifschneider at jon.reifschneider@duke.edu .
