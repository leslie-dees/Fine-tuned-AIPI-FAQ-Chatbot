- AIPI 501: Industry Seminar Series [0 units] (On-campus & Online MEng students)
The full list of Pratt courses will be made available to students on June, when shopping carts open in DukeHub. 

2. Academics: When will the list of Fall courses be available?
The list of all Fall courses offered by the Pratt School of Engineering will be made available to all incoming and continuing students in the end of June (for a specific data, look up ), the day that shopping carts open. This list can be accessed using the Simple and Advanced Class Search functions in DukeHub.

3. Academics: When can I register for classes?
Fall course registration for all graduate students will begin in July 1st or 2nd week in DukeHub. Students may continue making changes to their schedule during the Drop/Add period, which will end on first week of September. After Drop/Add ends, students may no longer change their Fall schedules in DukeHub.  

4. Academics: How do I register for classes?
All students register for classes through DukeHub, the self-service application that provides students with an array of information and direct access to academic, financial, and personal data. Access to DukeHub is gained using your NetID and password. For assistance with registration, please see the help guides linked here.

5. Academics: What classes outside of the AIPI curriculum can I count toward my technical electives requirement?
Approved AIPI electives are listed on the AIPI website.  Additionally, students may take technical electives in other programs and departments across campus with approval from both the course instructor and the AIPI Director. Please note that graduate courses outside of AIPI require an instructor�s permission to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor�s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class.

6. Academics: Can I audit classes? 
Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements.

7. Academics: How many classes can I audit per semester?
AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 

8. Academics: How many classes should I register for? 
In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester.  AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570).  AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).  Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis.

9. Academics: What is the limit on credits I can take each semester?
AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register.

10. Academics: What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period?
The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (usually first week of September), students schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean.

11. Academics: What is the last day that I can register for Fall classes?
Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends around first week of September usually. Please check the Duke Academic Calender for more details.

12. Academics: For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan?
No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters.

13. Academics: When do classes start?
Fall classes begin around 3rd week of August. For more details, please check the Duke Academic Calender

14. Academics: What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? 
Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 

15. Academics: How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses?
AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class.

17. Academics: Where can I find other important dates related to academics?
Duke Academic Calendar is the place for all important dates. We strongly recommend students bookmark this page in their browser for easy reference.

18. Academics: Where do I find other important information about the AIPI Program?
The AIPI student website contains a wealth of information about the AIPI program and life at Duke. University policies surrounding academics may also be found on the Office of the University Registrar website.

19. Academics: Is there a formal process for designating my elective track? 
No, there is not currently a formal process to designate your elective track. We do not require students to rigidly adhere to one elective track. Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward a particular area, and those students who complete a track may list it on their resume.

20. Academics: What do I do if I want to change my elective track?
If you wish to change your elective track, there is no formal action that you need to take. However, it is a good idea to speak with the program director about your elective course plans, as they can help steer you toward courses that align with your professional aspirations.

21. Academics: How can I track my degree progress?
Students can track their degree progress using Stellic, a self-service tool that enables students to see which classes they have taken toward their degree and plan for future semesters. Students are strongly encouraged to use Stellic throughout the course of the AIPI Program so that they can stay on track to graduate within the timeframe they choose (two or three semesters).

22. Tuition and Billing: How much does it cost to audit a course? 
For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course.

23. Tuition and Billing: How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students?
Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 

24. Tuition and Billing: Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit?
Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student�s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester.

25. Tuition and Billing: Is financial aid available to AIPI students? 
Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs. For more information on the most common financial aid resources that our students utilize, please click the link here. 

26. Tuition and Billing: How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position?
Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before.
In order to be on Duke's payroll, all students must have a Social Security Number on file. If a student intends to work on campus and be paid as an employee of the University, then that student should plan to apply for a Social Security Number. More information about applying for a Social Security Number may be found here. 

27. Tuition and Billing: What other employment positions are available for students on campus? 
In addition to Teaching Assistantships, AIPI students can work in a variety of roles around campus, such as the campus libraries and various departments within Duke. Some departments have research assistantships as well. These positions are paid at an hourly rate, and some positions are posted and filled just a week or two before classes begin each semester. DukeList is the best place to look for these opportunities, but other opportunities may be advertised via email or word-of-mouth. Please see DukeList for more information.

28. Tuition and Billing: Where can I find information about student employment?
DukeList is the best place to look for these opportunities, but other opportunities may be advertised via email or word-of-mouth. Please see DukeList for more information.

29. Tuition and Billing: I'm an international student. Can I work off-campus?
International students on F-1 visas are not permitted to work off-campus except as part of their Curricular Practical Training (CPT). Students who are F-1 visaholders may work in on-campus positions, such as teaching assistantships, but must have a Social Security Number to be on Duke payroll.

30. Student Services: I don't want to live alone, but I don't know anyone else at Duke. How do I find a roommate?
The onboarding checklist email sent from Bridget Kerwin included a number of resources regarding housing. Two resources of particular note if you are looking for a roommate are DukeList and the International House (I-House) listserv. DukeList is a forum for posting information on a range of topics to other Duke students, faculty, and staff. The I-House listserv is a great list to join if you are newly arrived to Duke and/or Durham and are looking for an apartment, roommate, and/or ride-sharing. 

31. Student Services: How do I find out about student activities and clubs to participate in?
There is a wide variety of student activities and clubs to get involved in at Duke.  A partial list of activities/clubs of interest is contained on the AIPI student website.  You are also encouraged to check out the Duke Event Calendar to check out upcoming events in a variety of topics, including the arts, athletics, academics, and civic engagement.

32. Whom do I contact about other visa questions I may have? 
In the Duke Visa Services Office, Betty Henderson (betty.henderson@duke.edu) is the Visa Services Advisor for Pratt students. You may also contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, for additional visa-related questions. 

33. How do I get my NetID and password?
You should receive a separate email from the Office of Information Technology (OIT) with instructions to set up your NetID and email alias. Your NetID is your electronic key to online resources, including your Duke email account, DukeHub, Sakai, MyDuke, Box cloud storage, and more. Please set up your NetID as soon as possible. 

34. When will I get access to my Duke email?
Once you set up your NetID (see above), you will be able to access your email. This site provides information about how to access your Duke email account. Once you have access to your Duke email, please begin checking and using this address. Your Duke email address will become the primary source for all your communications from Duke.

35. What can I do this summer to prepare for AIPI?
While some of our students come directly from undergraduate programs which focus heavily on programming and/or math, many students come from other branches of engineering, science or medicine, or join our program after a few years of industry experience. �Spending some time before the Fall semester start brushing up on your programming (Python preferable) and math skills will help make the learning curve a bit easier once classes start. �If you are not comfortable with Python programming and math (calculus, probability and statistics, basic linear algebra), we highly recommend pursuing some independent study before the Bootcamp begins in late July. To assist you we have compiled some recommended resources on the AIPI student site.
