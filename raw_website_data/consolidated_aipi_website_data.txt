Options for Duke Students and Graduates

Duke 4+1: Bachelor's + Master's

Duke undergrads can earn a bachelor's degree and a Master of Engineering or Master of Engineering Management degree in just five years through Duke's progressive 4+1 Masters program. Students who are admitted as undergradautes get a head start in this accelerated program by taking graduate level courses during their senior year.

Watch an overview »

Details to Remember

To be admitted while an undergraduate, complete our online application as early as the spring of your junior year or as late as the spring of your senior year and indicate that you are a 4+1 candidate. See our tips on choosing when to apply . An application fee waiver is available for Duke students , and Duke 4+1 applicants are not required to take the GRE.

You can allocate up to four departmental graduate courses * taken in your senior year toward your MEng/MEM degree requirements using the Pratt Credit Transfer form . Transferred courses must fulfill MEng/MEM degree requirements in the major of interest. Note: Only the credits transfer, the grade remains on your undergraduate transcript and is part of your undergraduate GPA.

You need to earn at least a B in each graduate level course for it to count toward your MEng/MEM degree.

Graduate courses used for your MEng/MEM degree cannot be used for your undergraduate degree

In order for students admitted as undergraduates to complete the program in only one additional year, you must complete the required internship the summer between your undergraduate degree and the start of your master's program at Duke.

International 4+1 students are strongly encouraged to use Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for the summer internship, as the internship is a required component of the degree, and the CPT process can be completed more quickly than OPT for your undergraduate degree. If you have questions on CPT eligibility, we encourage you to contact Duke Visa Services.

4+1 students admitted during the undergraduate program may defer admission for up to three years. Students may request to transfer their admission to one of the Master of Engineering Online programs or the Master of Engineering Management Online program.

Note

* The transfer of credit requires approval of the Director of Master of Engineering Studies (DMS) for the major of interest/Director of the MEM program and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs. AB Duke scholars and other students on a case-by-case basis may be able to allocate up to six courses towards the MEng degree only. Graduate courses are listed in the 500s or above.

When to Apply

Early Admission for Undergraduates — You have three options

Spring of Junior Year, for admission in Fall of Senior year

Fall of Senior Year, for admission in Spring of Senior year

Spring of Senior Year, for admission in Fall of Fifth year

N o matter when you apply, you'll remain an undergraduate for four years before becoming a MEng/MEM student in the fifth year. That means that you should select your application term based on when you'll actually join the program after graduation, not when you'd like to take and MEng/EGRMGMT or departmental graduate courses you plan to transfer. For that reason, the application will choose summer term 1 for the year of your BSE graduation, but your application will be considered and a decision will be posted in the admission timeline you seek.

Example: If you’d like a decision before you take the classes, apply using the deadlines the term in which you’ll take them. For example, if you want to take the classes in Spring, you'd apply using Spring admission deadlines to hear back by December 1 of your senior year.

Download a Checklist.

Important Note

4+1 students admitted to the MEng/MEM program while undergraduates remain an undergraduate for four years before becoming a MEng/MEM student in the fifth year. Typically, matriculation occurs in summer term 1 after the spring semester of the senior year, and students will complete the internship requirement within 1 year of matriculation. Students will be charged as undergraduates for the first four years and as MEng/MEM students for the fifth year. The MEng program charges tuition by semester, and payment by credit is not available in the fifth year. The MEM program charges 4+1 students by credit in the fifth year.

All 4+1s should submit paperwork for the transfer of credits from the student's undergraduate program into the MEng/MEM program within the first semester of starting the program.

In order to complete the program in only one additional year after being admitted as an undergraduate, a 4+1 must complete the required internship the summer between the undergraduate degree and the start of the MEng/MEM program. 4+1 students should seek approval from the department before beginning the internship.

The MEng core courses / MEM(EGRMGMT) courses are available to undergraduates who have been admitted to the 4+1 program on a space available basis. After admission, 4+1 students work with our academic coordinator to receive permission numbers to allow registration for MENG/EGRMGMT courses while an undergraduate. Not all graduate level courses are available to undergraduates and permission numbers will only be provided for MENG/EGRMGMT courses. If a 4+1 undergraduate student desires to take graduate level electives classes that are not available to undergraduates, a 4+1 student should take these courses in the fifth year of study.

Trinity students need to plan their undergraduate courses carefully to ensure they allow room in their schedule for graduate level courses in their senior year. Students without room in their senior year may require more than one additional year to complete the MEng degree – contact us for more information .

Contact the admissions office for more information.

4+1 for Duke Graduates

If you're a recent Duke graduate who has taken graduate engineering courses that weren't used for your Duke bachelor's degree, you may apply for 4+1 admission up to five years after graduation.

Details to Remember

To be admitted as alumnus, complete our online application within five years of graduation, and indicate you a recent graduate (2018-2022 bachelor’s degree) of Duke University who plans to apply to the 4+1 program. An application fee waiver is available for Duke alumni , and Duke 4+1 applicants are not required to take the GRE

You can allocate up to four departmental graduate courses * taken in your senior year toward your MEng/MEM degree requirements using the Pratt Credit Transfer form . Transferred courses must fulfill MEng/MEM degree requirements in the major of interest. Note: Only the credits transfer, the grade remains on your undergraduate transcript and is part of your undergraduate GPA

You need to earn at least a B in each graduate level course for it to count toward your MEng/MEM degree

Graduate courses used for your MEng/MEM degree cannot be used for your undergraduate degree

Any Duke alumnus may apply for 4+1 up to five years after graduating from Duke's undergraduate program, and Duke offers several Master of Engineering Online programs as well as the Master of Engineering Management Online program

Note

* The transfer of credit requires approval of the Director of Master of Engineering Studies (DMS) for the major of interest/Director of the MEM program and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs. AB Duke scholars and other students on a case-by-case basis may be able to allocate up to six courses towards the degree. Graduate courses are listed in the 500s or above.

Important Notice

Alumni 4+1s are charged as MEng/MEM students for the fifth year. The MEng program charges tuition by semester, and payment by credit is not available in the fifth year. The MEM program charges 4+1 students by credit in the fifth year.

All 4+1s should submit paperwork for the transfer of credits from the student's undergraduate program into the MEng/MEM program within the first semester of starting the program.

In order to complete the program in only one additional year, a 4+1 must complete the required internship. Alumni who are admitted may sometimes use work experience in lieu of the internship.

Alumni without extraneous graduate courses year may require more than one additional year to complete the MEng degree – contact us for more information .

Contact the admissions office for more information.

Duke PhD Students in Engineering

Students who received their PhD degree from the Pratt School of Engineering may also want to pursue a MEng degree to obtain the breadth found in the MEng core courses.

To facilitate this, PhD students may utilize their PhD courses to fulfill the technical course requirements of the MEng degree (i.e., the eight noncore course requirements) if those courses meet the curricular requirements of the MEng major of interest. Thus, PhD students may obtain the MEng degree by adding the two MEng core courses to their coursework and fulfilling the internship requirements.

Note that generally the student’s PhD research will not be acceptable as the internship experience for the concurrent MEng degree. Students must apply for the MEng Program independently from the PhD and must be enrolled in the MEng Program (i.e., dual enrolled in the MEng and PhD) before taking the MEng core courses. Students should register for these MEng core courses separately from their PhD courses under their MEng “bookbag” and will be billed for these courses separately from their PhD. Other MEng courses to be utilized to fulfill the MEng requirements may be taken at anytime while a PhD student, before or after enrolling in the MEng Program.

Note that being accepted as a PhD student does not guarantee acceptance as an MEng student. Note that students will generally receive their MEng degree at the same time or after receiving their PhD. If a student does not obtain a PhD, only four of the technical courses taken as a PhD student may be applied to the MEng degree. The other four technical MEng course requirements and the MEng core courses must be taken after enrollment in the MEng Program.

All PhD students should discuss their plans with their faculty advisor for their research program and with the DMS for their major of interest. When applying for the MEng degree, he/she should indicate they are already a PhD student and plan to do the MEng concurrently with his/her PhD.

Duke MD Students

MD-Master of Engineering Dual Degree Program

MD candidates in Duke’s School of Medicine have the option of adding the Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in a 5-year program. Students spend four years (Years 1, 2, 4 and 5) in medical school to fulfill the MD curriculum requirements, and one year (Year 3) to take the required MEng courses. In the fourth year, students work on development of new technologies or engineering approaches (including optimization/system analysis or feasibility analysis, etc.) for improving human health and write a thesis, for which they will receive School of Medicine credit in fulfillment of their Third Year thesis requirement.

School of Medicine Requirements

The MD curriculum requirements for typical Years 1, 2, and 4 (Year 5 for dual students) remain unchanged by this program.

School of Medicine Third Year thesis credit will be based on submission of a document whose rigor is consistent with current Third Year theses. As with all current Third Year theses, the thesis proposals will require Third Year School of Medicine approval. The thesis would consist of a detailed Business Plan, complete with extended Introduction (similar to the extended Introduction currently required of Third Year students who choose the manuscript or grant alternative theses) stating more thoroughly the human health need being addressed. The scope, subject, and outcomes of the thesis will be determined by the Engineering program of specialization in collaboration with the School of Medicine. A thesis alternative can be submitted in the form of a SBIR/STTR grant application since the grant thesis alternative is already an approved option offered to all Third Year medical students. At the discretion of and selected by the Third Year Committee, the thesis may be reviewed by faculty or other experts well versed in the specific technology field who are not on the Committee. These external reviews would be used by members of the Third Year Committee to grade the theses in order to ensure that the grading standards, rigor and criteria are consistent with current theses. The thesis may also be used to fulfill requirements for the MEng 550/551 courses.

Pratt School of Engineering Requirements

Master of Engineering students in all majors must complete 30 credits comprised of key program elements as follows:

Core industry preparatory courses (6 credits)

Departmental or interdisciplinary core courses (15 - 18 credits, varies by major)

Technical electives in a concentrated area (6 - 9 credits, varies by major)

Internship, Project, or Equivalent

Additionally, some majors have a seminar participation requirement.

The MD/MEng student will fulfill all of the requirements of the MEng degree. To accomplish this, the following accommodation has been made for those seeking a dual degree:

6-9 credits (depends on MEng major) required for the MEng degree may be fulfilled based on satisfactory completion of the School of Medicine 1 Basic Sciences curriculum. See table below:

Internship, project, or equivalent requirement may be fulfilled as described below.

In the fourth year, each MEng student is required to undertake a practical internship, which must encompass at least 320 hours of effort (as documented in their detailed laboratory notebook). These internships are by nature focused on engineering applications and technology development. To achieve this, each MD/MEng student may work under the auspices of Faculty in the School of Medicine, MedBlue Program, the Pratt School of Engineering, or other similar program to be reviewed and approved by representatives from the MEng and SOM faculty. Specifically, each MD/MEng candidate will:

work under the guidance of one or two attending physicians and engineers during their 4 th year (“second third year”) to identify and complete at least one comprehensive Confidential Need Specification with the sponsorship of one of the clinical faculty;

develop new technologies or engineering approaches (including optimization/system analysis or feasibility analysis, etc.) for improving human health based on the Need Specification;

present their proposed technology or engineering approach to a select group of prospective investors and/or end users (clinicians);

complete an Invention Disclosure Form approved by faculty advisor for the project and the faculty who teach the internship course, MEng 551

(optional) submit the IDF, which requires review and signature of appropriate SOM Department Chair; review and signature by appropriate Engineering Department Chair.

(optional) provide required information and support to OLV to assist in their review and action.

Example Curriculum

The MD/MEng is most closely aligned with the Biomedical Engineering major and is ideal for medical students with an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. The example below shows the Pratt course work requirements for a major in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Healthcare Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

Application Requirements and Process

The applicant must be in good standing with the School of Medicine. Applications should be submitted using an application to the Master of Engineering program. MD/MEng students should indicate on their application that they will be pursuing MEng as a concurrent degree.

Students interested in this program should apply no later than March 15 in the second year of the MD program.

See the links below for more information.

Application Deadlines

Application Requirements (Note that applicants may use MCAT scores in lieu of GRE scores for the MD-MEng dual degree only.)

Apply Online

Review Process

The student must inform the Third Year Study Program Director in the School of Medicine, the Director of Masters Studies in the appropriate MEng major, and the Pratt Professional Masters Admissions Office so that the application and dual degree plan can be reviewed and approved separately from the Pratt School general admissions review.

Tuition

Students will pay Master of Engineering tuition for one year (two semesters) after the MS2 year and School of Medicine tuition for four years (SoM 1, SoM 2, SoM 3 [year 4], and SoM 4[year 5]). The typical MEng degree is 3 semesters and so obtaining a concurrent degree saves students the equivalent of one semester of tuition compared to obtaining both degrees separately.

Granting of Degree

Because this is a concurrent degree and Medical School courses are being used to fulfill MEng degree requirements, the MEng degree will be granted simultaneous to the granting of the MD degree, typically at the end of the 5 th year. If a MD/MEng student leaves the MD program before completing both degrees, a case-by-case analysis may be performed to determine if the MEng degree may be granted independently or if additional coursework is required to independently fulfill the MEng degree requirements. Since no accommodation has been made to the MD requirements, students withdrawing from the MEng degree will not impact MD degree requirements.

Duke Graduate and Professional Students in Other Departments

Duke graduate and professional students who are not enrolled in the MEng Program may register for the two MEng core courses on a space-available basis and with permission of the instructor. Instructors will require students to have sufficient background for the course as needed AND may also limit outside enrollment for any pedagogical reason.

Non-MEng students should complete the following steps to get into the course:

Complete the Non-MEng Registration form

On the form, obtain permission from the instructor and from their home department either in e-mail or with a signature

Return the form to the Academic Coordinator at 3120 Fitzpatrick (CIEMAS)

Important Notice

The MEng Office does not process forms until all MEng students have a chance to enroll, so you may not officially be added to the class until the end of the first week of classes.

Non-MEng students will not be added to wait lists but are added to classes in the order in which they completed their form.

Generally no more than five non-MEng students will be allowed to enroll in a course at any given time.

Students who enroll in MEng courses as non-MEng students may not utilize these courses for an MEng degree.

The deadline to submit this form is the last day of drop/add, usually two weeks after the start of the semester.

For questions, please contact our office .

"Duke's 4+1:Bachelor's + Master's Program was the perfect opportunity for me to spend one more year on a beautiful campus, earn my Master’s degree, and share Duke, my alma mater, with Master of Engineering program peers from around the world."

Inaugural Generative AI Hackathon Launches Imaginations

One of 2023’s greatest enduring legacies will undoubtedly be the explosion of generative AI platforms and technologies like ChatGPT.

From conducting simple conversations to helping code entire websites, the potential uses for generative AI are just starting to be explored. As is always the case with emerging technologies, there’s no shortage of curious college students eager to tinker and experiment with it to discover new uses that haven’t yet been dreamed of.

To encourage this innovative spirit and help students get their feet wet with generative AI, Duke Engineering recently hosted its inaugural Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Hackathon.

Hackathons are typically weekend-long events in which participants creatively, collaboratively and quickly use technology to build ideas into demonstrations, or “demos,” showcased at the end of the event.

“There is tremendous interest among our students in AI, and particularly Generative AI, and we wanted to create an opportunity for them to get hands-on with the technology and build something meaningful within a supportive, fun environment,” said Jon Reifschneider , executive director of Duke’s Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence . “The quality and variety of the hacks that were developed was inspiring. We saw tremendous creativity in how the technology could be used across a wide range of application areas.”

The GenAI Hackathon drew 148 students to campus, representing a wide range of majors from Duke, Elon University and North Carolina State University, for a 42-hour, caffeine-fueled imagination and creation event. Teams worked to generate ideas, form teams and develop prototypes from 6:00 pm on a Friday through 9:00 am on a Sunday.

The quality and variety of the hacks that were developed was inspiring. We saw tremendous creativity in how the technology could be used across a wide range of application areas.

The event was organized by an enthusiastic group of students organized by Reifschneider along with Vivek Rao , executive director of Duke Engineering’s new Design & Technology Innovation Master of Engineering .

The group also received support from global AI leaders OpenAI and Microsoft in the form of generous AI compute credits for hackathon participants and larger amounts as prizes for the top teams.

This allowed participants in the Hackathon to engage with, for example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 API, which would typically be difficult for students to access. The organizers also led a series of technical tutorials and hosted office hours throughout the weekend to help students build and code their ideas.

“The Hackathon was special as it gave me access to use the latest AI tools, at no cost, in a creative way for a special learning and building experience,” said Devin Shah , a senior in biomedical engineering.

Leaders of the GenAI Hackathon go over some basic information about the underlying technology before the hacking begins.

When dreaming up potential projects to pursue, however, the competition’s prompt wasn’t simply open-ended. Teams were encouraged to come up with uses for generative AI that would serve some sort of social or community service—a directive that students and sponsors alike could get behind.

“Encouraging the next generation to engage with AI technology in a hands-on way aligns perfectly with OpenAI’s mission to ensure AI benefits all of humanity,” said Shyamal Anadkat , a 2022 graduate of Duke’s AI Master of Engineering program, who is now an applied AI leader at OpenAI and supporter of the Hackathon.

“Events like the GenAI Hackathon really take what we learn in the classroom and push us to translate that into experiences and events for the community,” added Archit Kaila , a student in the AI Master of Engineering program and one of the event’s organizers. “That’s something really special about being at Duke.”

Nearly 150 students from colleges across North Carolina showed up to the inaugural GenAI Hackathon.

During the Hackathon, participants formed interdisciplinary teams to develop projects in one of five tracks:

Health & Wellness

Education & Knowledge Management

Enterprise & Finance, Entertainment

Arts & Travel, and Social Impact

Sustainability & Environment

The result was 32 completed projects by the end of the weekend. Eight judges, representing Duke faculty and alumni, worked in pairs to systematically evaluate them all and name finalists for each track. The work was presented to the entire audience.

“I was blown away by the creativity and execution behind all of the projects I saw,” said Andy Chan , GenAI Hackathon judge, Fuqua School of Business MBA graduate, and CEO and founder of ScriptScouts , a technology startup focusing on the pharmaceuticals space. “I love that while AI technology keeps advancing, students keep learning and building, and the hackathon really shows that.”

The range and depth of demo-ready projects that emerged really highlights the students’ eagerness to work with the latest technologies to address problems that matter.

At the end of the competition, the judges ultimately selected BunnyBotBeacon, a robotic plush bunny rabbit that functioned as a speaking and listening mental health chatbot. The project was built by Annabelle Chu, a Duke senior majoring in electrical and computer engineering , who wowed the judges with her project’s unique blend of hardware, software and focus on a meaningful problem.

Annabelle Chu, Duke senior in electrical and computer engineering, hacks into her winning entry “BunnyBotBeacon, a robotic plush bunny rabbit that functioned as a speaking and listening mental health chatbot.

“At this hackathon, I really enjoyed bringing together all the skills I’ve learned at Duke, covering everything from coding and circuit design to CAD and 3D printing, into one big project,” Chu said. “When the BunnyBot was finally up and running, it was really rewarding to see all the different aspects work together to address the challenge of mental health using Generative AI.”

As part of the winning prize, Chu received automatic entry into Microsoft’s Imagine Cup, for which she’s assembling a team to take BunnyBotBeacon forward, and recently met with Duke Capital Partners , the venture capital fund supporting high-impact startups emerging from the Duke ecosystem.

Also leaving the event with a prize was Jiechen Li, a student in Duke’s Masters of Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) program , whose team won the beginner track for their work on their project, “TalkwithMe.” Li was invited to share her project with Microsoft’s Azure Educator Developer Blog , a home for novel work in product development related to Artificial Intelligence.

“Before coming to Duke, I was a product analyst for many years,” Li said. “I knew how to analyze products and understand their market potential, but I didn’t have the technical tools to prototype them, especially products using the latest artificial intelligence technology.”

“The range and depth of demo-ready projects that emerged really highlights the students’ eagerness to work with the latest technologies to address problems that matter,” said Rao, who is already looking forward to organizing the next iteration of the event. “I’m really excited to see what our Hackathon students build next.”

On a January afternoon in a sunlit room in Penn Pavilion, some three dozen people gathered for a glimpse of what’s new with some of today’s generative AI tools, and what could be waiting on the horizon.

At the front of the room, Duke professor Matt Hirschey navigated to Bing.com, where Microsoft has incorporated chatbot technology into its new AI-powered search engine.

Go ahead, the site said. Ask it to draft an email about diversity and inclusion on campus, come up with a funny joke for your colleagues, or create a worksheet for 11th graders studying the Civil War.

“This is Microsoft’s take on what AI can do to make your life easier,” Hirschey said.

Another tool he tried worked like ChatGPT for PowerPoint, proclaiming: “Welcome to a new way of creating presentations.”

“Of course, this new way is you sipping your coffee while the AI makes the presentation for you,” Hirschey said.

He showed off the resulting slide deck, noting that some might find the headers a little generic. “But we'll give it a break. This is literally a presentation that was made at the click of a button.”

Panel moderator Daniel Dardani

The demo was part of an AI-themed panel at Duke Research & Innovation Week 2024 , held Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 as part of the Duke Centennial celebration.

What we now call AI has been around as a discipline for decades, said moderator and tech transfer expert Daniel Dardani of Duke's Office for Translation and Commercialization and the Office of External Partnerships.

But AI tools like ChatGPT have pushed the technology into public view.

Which raises an obvious question, Dardani said. “What’s different about AI today, and what could come next?”

This isn’t the first time AI has captured the public imagination, said AI and machine learning expert Larry Carin , former chair of electrical and computer engineering and former Vice Provost for Research at Duke.

Over its history, the field has gone through repeated cycles of booms and busts -- periods of remarkable progress and optimism followed by skepticism.

These cycles are known as the “seasons of AI,” Carin said, and “we’re definitely experiencing an AI summer.”

But this moment seems different, Carin added. It’s not just another bubble of inflated expectations. “We’re in a different phase,” Carin said.

“Most of the focus right now in AI is really on productivity,” said Hirschey, a professor of medicine who also directs Duke’s Center for Computational Thinking .

Imagine a harried physician. In a regular week, many doctors spend nearly half their time entering data and doing deskwork. AI-powered voice assistants that integrate with patients’ electronic health records could make charting easier so that doctors can focus more on patient care.

Or take any office job. Increasingly, companies are integrating “ AI assistants ” into office apps like Word, Gmail or Excel. These AIs could save users time by automating or offloading tedious tasks such as scheduling meetings or managing email.

“There's something deep about human nature that is looking not for shortcuts, but we’ll say for ‘productivity enhancement opportunities,’” Hirschey said.

And indeed the potential gains are impressive. According to the accounting and auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the boost in productivity enabled by AI could add $6.6 trillion to the global economy by 2030. That’s more than the GDPs of Canada and the U.K. combined.

“So it's not surprising that it starts here,” Hirschey said. “But I think the most exciting prospect is beyond productivity.”

In education, for example, AI chatbots could serve as students’ personal tutors, clarifying and reviewing concepts based on content from a syllabus or textbook.

Hirshey asked one such bot to “teach me the fundamentals of large language models from an undergrad level,” and the AI came back with an answer almost instantly.

“This is a new way to interact with course material,” Hirschey said.

Such tools aren’t perfect. When he asked the AI tutor for clarification, typing in “I don’t quite understand,” the chatbot choked. It came back with “error analyzing.”

“That just shows you it's a real demo,” he chuckled.

In another demo, Hirschey showed off a custom chatbot he created called “Ghost Scientist.”

It differs from regular ChatGPT in that it was programmed for a specific task, in this case to suggest experiments that could be carried out. After asking the audience to call out fields they were working in, he chose two answers at random and typed: “how would I use light microscopy to study ion channels?”

In an instant the AI came back with a list of ideas, ranked based on feasibility.

Some experts might skim this list and say, “that's totally bogus, or that's not going to work,” Hirschey said. But the point is “we can also build tools that help us come up with ideas,” Hirschey said. “We can use AI to help brainstorm.”

“Right now everyone is thinking about AI as a task completer,” Hirschey said. “But really we should be thinking about AI as an educator, an idea generator, or even as a thought partner.”

If you had told an AI-savvy audience even five years ago that such things would soon be possible, Carin said, “I think everybody would have just laughed. No chance.”

To tech insiders, Carin said, “This is unbelievable technology. It is a tremendous accomplishment of sustained research over many decades.”

“But now we have new questions,” Carin added. “Such as: who owns this?”

Tech giants like Google and Microsoft are facing a barrage of lawsuits alleging that scraping data from the web to train their AI systems violates people’s privacy or property rights.

“I've never seen the technology evolve so much quicker than the law,” said Duke alum Lee Tiedrich , who practiced law for 30 years at the forefront of AI and other emerging technologies before returning to Duke as an executive in residence at Pratt.

“Even the patent office and copyright officers are struggling with the implications of AI on traditional intellectual property bedrock concepts,” Dardani said.

“There seems to be some consensus across the aisles that big tech needs to be reined in,” Tiedrich added. Just a few months ago the White House unveiled a sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence, joining a number of countries around the world in calling for stronger guardrails around AI.

“It’s still the Wild West, but policymakers are trying very hard to tame it,” Tiedrich said. The goal is to “capitalize on all the great benefits that artificial intelligence brings, but also make sure that we mitigate the risks.”

One of the clearest lessons from the panel was that we've only just begun to see what's possible with AI.

“It's early,” Hirschey said. “We still don't know exactly how these tools work, what their limitations are, or the full implications of their use.”

Looking ahead, however, AI agents could be embedded inside every app we use. One study suggests that a third of college students are already using ChatGPT for schoolwork.

“There's no question that it’s going to be used,” Carin said.

Dardani brought the discussion to a close with one final quip: “If there’s any portion of today that you forget and want to double back on, don’t worry -- just ask ChatGPT.”
