Tuition and Fees Refund Policy

Tuition and mandatory fees are required to be paid in full, regardless of:

any changes to instructional content, schedule, or duration of the semester;

any inability to access Duke University-maintained facilities; and

any disruption to or cancellation of activities, events, services or programs during the academic year.

For the avoidance of doubt, and as has been the Policy of Duke University in the past, tuition and mandatory fees will not be refunded in whole or in part for any reason, except as provided for under the Refund Policy . By paying the tuition and mandatory fees, the student and anyone paying tuition on his or her behalf acknowledges and accepts these terms.
