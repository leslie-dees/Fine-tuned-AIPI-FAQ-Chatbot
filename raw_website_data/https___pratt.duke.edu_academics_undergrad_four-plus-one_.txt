4+1: Bachelors & Masters Program

What a Difference a Year Can Make

For our undergraduates, an additional year (and a little planning) means they launch from Duke with a master’s degree in just five years. We call it 4+1.

This dual-degree option is available in all our engineering master’s programs —Master of Engineering, Master of Science and Master of Engineering Management. 4+1 also available for the Master of Science offered by the Duke University Program in Materials Science & Engineering.
